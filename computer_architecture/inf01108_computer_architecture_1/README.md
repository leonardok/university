Repository to hold works from INF01108 UFRGS course
Code in here is poorly written as I had no time for optimizations and further revision. In special the work 2 has a bug where the consistency of numbers greater than 16823 is not correctly done, it only works if the user enters a lesser than 65535 (16bit number).
